Project 1

Welcome to Whats for Dinner! By Kyle Cooper, Kobe Matias, and Erica Cannedy.
Our application is designed to help you decide what to have for dinner while also pairing a drink recommendation. 

On loading the page, four choices to choose your protein are available. 

Please pick your protein: Beef, Chicken, Pork, Vegetarian.

According to your protein choice, the application will display four meals that contain your protein choice. At the bottom of the page, 3 drink recommendations that pair well with displayed meals will appear. 

If you do not like the recommendations provided for you, you can reload both the meal and drinks seperately by clicking the blue reload buttons underneath the meal and drink titles. 

Click on each meal or drink and a modal will appear with the ingredients and the recipe for the selected item. 

For this project, we used TheCocktailDB.com and TheMealDB.com API's.
